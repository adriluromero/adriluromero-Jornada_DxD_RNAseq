#Drought Disturbance Experiment

#Adriana L. Romero-Olivares' protocol for processing RNAseq data of soil
#Pipeline ran by Andrea Lopez
#Section 2
#File name: 2_Clean_trim_QC
#Step: Cleaning-trimming of raw reads

#In this script, you will: 

# 1. Unzip files with the .fastq.gz extension into files that have a .fastq extension.  
# 2. Create a FastQC report to look at the quality of the sequences.  
# 3. Combine the individual FastQC reports into MultiQC reports for Inter- and Underspace samples.  
# 4. Trim the sequences using Trimmomatic version 0.39.   
# 5. Move the trimmed files based on whether or not they will be used for downstream analyses.
# 6. Generate a FastQC of the trimmed sequences.
# 7. Use MultiQC to get one report for inter- and underspace samples.
