#Drought Disturbance Experiment

#Adriana L. Romero-Olivares' protocol for processing RNAseq data of soil
#Pipeline ran by Andrea Lopez
#Section 1
#File name: 1_Preparing_files_for_pipeline
#Step: Unzipping and merging of sequencing files

#In this script, you will: 
# 1. Unzip the four file folders received from the sequencing facility. 
# 2. Move the files into a Run1, Run2, Run3, and runfour directory.
# 3. Merge the four similarly named files from each of the 4 diectories.  
# 4. Move the files into the Runs-Inter or Runs-Under directory based on the file name. 

#1 & 2. Unzip the 3 file folders and move files to separate directories. 

#Begin with Run 1

#Next, Run 3

#Lastly, Run 4
