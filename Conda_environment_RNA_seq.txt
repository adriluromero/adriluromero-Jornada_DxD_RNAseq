#Step: Building your conda environment for analysis of rna sequencing data.

#Follow these steps to create the 'rna_seq' Conda environment used throughout this pipeline. 

#First, install Anaconda if you haven't done so. 

#Next, download the 'rna_seq.yml' file. 

#Load Anaconda.

module load conda 

#Create the environment using this command.

conda env create -f rna_seq.yml

#Optional. Practice activating the 'rna_seq' environment.
